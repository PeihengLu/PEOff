Last year saw the first FDA approved CRISPR therapy - Casgevy - for the treatment of sickle cell disease, which took a remarkably short time of 11 years to go from the first CRISPR-Cas9 paper to the first FDA approval\cite{CRISPRClinicalTrials}. This is highly inspiring for more advanced CRISPR technologies including base editing and prime editing, both of which have been shown to have great potential in curing genetic diseases. I am planning to make contact with various wet labs to validate the model's prediction on their prime editing experiments, understanding their needs and better incorporating the in silico development model into their workflow.
