PRIDICT provided the HGVS(Human Genome Variation Society) notation of the intended edits, as well as the direction of the target strand(forward or reverse, in relation to the reference genome). Using the given information, GeneBe was able to map the target site to the hg38 coordinates, and given the relative location of the edit to the SpCas9 target site, the precise 23 bp target site could be calculated\cite{stawinskiGenebenetImplementationValidation2024}. The flank sequence is then generated using genomepy, a Python package that acquires the reference genome sequence given the coordinates.
