  abstract = {The specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is largely determined by the sequences of guide RNA (gRNA) and the targeted DNA, yet the sequence-dependent rules underlying off-target effects are not fully understood. To systematically explore the sequence determinants governing CRISPR/Cas9 specificity, here we describe a dual-target system to measure the relative cleavage rate between off- and on-target sequences (off-on ratios) of 1902 gRNAs on 13,314 synthetic target sequences, and reveal a set of sequence rules involving 2 factors in off-targeting: 1) a guide-intrinsic mismatch tolerance (GMT) independent of the mismatch context; 2) an “epistasis-like” combinatorial effect of multiple mismatches, which are associated with the free-energy landscape in R-loop formation and are explainable by a multi-state kinetic model. These sequence rules lead to the development of MOFF, a model-based predictor of Cas9-mediated off-target effects. Moreover, the “epistasis-like” combinatorial effect suggests a strategy of allele-specific genome editing using mismatched guides. With the aid of MOFF prediction, this strategy significantly improves the selectivity and expands the application domain of Cas9-based allele-specific editing, as tested in a high-throughput allele-editing screen on 18 cancer hotspot mutations.},

  abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

Here we report the use of prime editors 2 and 3, delivered by hydrodynamic injection, in mice with the genetic liver disease hereditary tyrosinemia, and of prime editor 2, delivered by an adeno-associated virus vector, in mice with the genetic eye disease Leber congenital amaurosis. For each pathogenic mutation, we identified an optimal prime-editing guide RNA by using cells transduced with lentiviral libraries of guide-RNA-encoding sequences paired with the corresponding target sequences. The prime editors precisely corrected the disease-causing mutations and led to the amelioration of the disease phenotypes in the mice, without detectable off-target edits. Prime editing should be tested further in more animal models of genetic diseases.},

We design a library of 3,604 sequences of various lengths and measure the frequency of their insertion into four genomic sites in three human cell lines, using different prime editor systems in varying DNA repair contexts. We find that length, nucleotide composition and secondary structure of the insertion sequence all affect insertion rates. We also discover that the 3′ flap nucleases TREX1 and TREX2 suppress the insertion of longer sequences. Combining the sequence and repair features into a machine learning model, we can predict relative frequency of insertions into a site with               R               \,=\,0.70. Finally, we demonstrate how our accurate prediction and user-friendly software help choose codon variants of common fusion tags that insert at high efficiency, and provide a catalog of empirically determined insertion rates for over a hundred useful sequences.},

However, methods to delineate their genome-wide editing activities have generally relied on indirect genome-wide editing assessments or the computational prediction of near-cognate sequences. Here we describe a genome-wide approach for the identification of potential prime editor off-target sites, which we call PE-tag. This method relies on the attachment or insertion of an amplification tag at sites of prime editor activity to allow their identification. PE-tag enables genome-wide profiling of off-target sites in vitro using extracted genomic DNA, in mammalian cell lines and in the adult mouse liver. PE-tag components can be delivered in a variety of formats for off-target site detection. Our studies are consistent with the high specificity previously described for prime editor systems, but we find that off-target editing rates are influenced by prime editing guide RNA design. PE-tag represents an accessible, rapid and sensitive approach for the genome-wide identification of prime editor activity and the evaluation of prime editor safety.},

However, off-target effects remain a significant challenge, potentially leading to unintended consequences and limiting the applicability of CRISPR-based genome editing technologies in clinical settings. Current literature predominantly focuses on point predictions for off-target activity, which may not fully capture the range of possible outcomes and associated risks. Here, we present crispAI, a neural network architecture-based approach for predicting uncertainty estimates for off-target cleavage activity, providing a more comprehensive risk assessment and facilitating improved decision-making in single guide RNA (sgRNA) design. Our approach makes use of the count noise model Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) to model the uncertainty in the off-target cleavage activity data. In addition, we present the first-of-itskind genome-wide sgRNA efficiency score, crispAI-aggregate, enabling prioritization among sgRNAs with similar point aggregate predictions by providing richer information compared to existing aggregate scores. We show that uncertainty estimates of our approach are calibrated and its predictive performance is superior to the state-of-the-art in silico off-target cleavage activity prediction methods.
